# My Digital CV

This was one of my intial websites I created using simple HTML and CSS which served as my digital CV. I have also deployed it over the internet using surge. You can view the website using this url: https://faizandigitalcv.surge.sh/ . 
The website was programmed to be responsive to different screen resolution as can be seen below:
